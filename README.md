The ever popular kitty-that-follows-your-mouse-pointer toy.


Neko is Japanese for cat. According to  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neko_(software)) it was originally written for the NEC PC-9801.

There are many many versions. Generally it is considered Public Domain software, so I am placing my fork under the Unlicense.

This fork is based on [Werner Randelshofer's Java port](http://www.randelshofer.ch/blog/2010/07/screenmate-neko-in-java).

The image files are ancient public domain.
The Java code for v.1.0 is (c) 2010 Werner Randelhofer.
The Java code for v.2.0 (c) 2019 Gerald Reno

THE GOAL:

THE WINDOW CREATED FROM CLICKING ON THE CAT SHOULD HAVE A GREEN BACKGROUND.

I'm not there yet. Not sure why changing the sRGB values on InvisibleWindow or catbox don't alter the window created from clicking on said cat.
